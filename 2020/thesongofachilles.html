          <p>As if he had heard me, he reached for my hand. I did not need to look; his fingers were etched into my memory, slender and petal-veined, strong and quick and never wrong.</p>

        <p>Chiron had said once that nations were the most foolish of mortal inventions. “No man is worth more than another, wherever he is from.”</p>
        <p>“But what if he is your friend?” Achilles had asked him, feet kicked up on the wall of the rose-quartz cave. “Or your brother? Should you treat him the same as a stranger?”</p>
        <p>“You ask a question that philosophers argue over,” Chiron had said. “He is worth more to you, perhaps. But the stranger is someone else’s friend and brother. So which life is more important?”</p>
        <p>We had been silent. We were fourteen, and these things were too hard for us. Now that we are twenty-seven, they still feel too hard.</p>
        <p>He is half of my soul, as the poets say. He will be dead soon, and his honor is all that will remain. It is his child, his dearest self. Should I reproach him for it? I have saved Briseis. I cannot save them all.</p>
        <p>I know, now, how I would answer Chiron. I would say: there is no answer. Whichever you choose, you are wrong.</p>
